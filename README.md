This package provides mutex implementation and allows mutual execution of concurrent processes in order to prevent
"race conditions".

This is achieved by using a "lock" mechanism. Each possibly concurrent processes cooperates by acquiring
a lock before accessing the corresponding data.

## Requirements

- PHP 7.4 or higher.

## Installation

The package could be installed with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):

```shell
composer require yiisoft/mutex
```

## General usage

There are multiple ways you can use the package. You can execute a callback in a synchronized mode i.e. only a
single instance of the callback is executed at the same time:

```php
/** @var \Yiisoft\Mutex\Synchronizer $synchronizer */
$newCount = $synchronizer->execute('critical', function () {
    return $counter->increase();
}, 10);
```

Another way is to manually open and close mutex:

```php
/** @var \Yiisoft\Mutex\SimpleMutex $simpleMutex */
if (!$simpleMutex->acquire('critical', 10)) {
    throw new \Yiisoft\Mutex\Exception\MutexLockedException('Unable to acquire the "critical" mutex.');
}
$newCount = $counter->increase();
$simpleMutex->release('critical');
```

It could be done on lower level:

```php
/** @var \Yiisoft\Mutex\MutexFactoryInterface $mutexFactory */
$mutex = $mutexFactory->createAndAcquire('critical', 10);
$newCount = $counter->increase();
$mutex->release();
```

And if you want even more control, you can acquire mutex manually:

```php
/** @var \Yiisoft\Mutex\MutexFactoryInterface $mutexFactory */
$mutex = $mutexFactory->create('critical');
if (!$mutex->acquire(10)) {
    throw new \Yiisoft\Mutex\Exception\MutexLockedException('Unable to acquire the "critical" mutex.');
}
$newCount = $counter->increase();
$mutex->release();
```

## Mutex drivers

There are some mutex drivers available as separate packages:

- [File](https://github.com/yiisoft/mutex-file)
- [PDO MySQL](https://github.com/yiisoft/mutex-pdo-mysql)
- [PDO Oracle](https://github.com/yiisoft/mutex-pdo-oracle)
- [PDO Postgres](https://github.com/yiisoft/mutex-pdo-pgsql)
- [Redis](https://github.com/yiisoft/mutex-redis)

If you want to provide your own driver, you need to implement `MutexFactoryInterface` and `MutexInterface`.
There is ready to extend `Mutex`, `MutexFactory` and a `RetryAcquireTrait` that contains `retryAcquire()`
method implementing the "wait for a lock for a certain time" functionality.

When implementing your own drivers, you need to take care of automatic unlocking. For example using a destructor:

```php
public function __destruct()
{
    $this->release();
}
```

and shutdown function:

```php
public function __construct()
{
    register_shutdown_function(function () {
        $this->release();
    });
}
```

Note that you should not call the `exit()` or `die()` functions in the destructor or shutdown function. Since calling
these functions in the destructor and shutdown function will prevent all subsequent completion functions from executing.
